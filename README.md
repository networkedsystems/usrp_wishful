It includes:
- C code for FD MAC design directly on FPGA
    - Code and tutorial are inside the CSMA_MAC_and_Tutorial.zip archive

- Python implementation of the USRP testbed controller using wishful UPIs:
    - The test_upis.py file contains an example of usage of the wishful UPIs.
    - The code can also be used "stand alone" without calling the wishful code.
    - The file Tutorial.docx contains instructions for using the code with or without the wishful UPIs.
